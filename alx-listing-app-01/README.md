# 🏡 ALX Listing App

## 🌟 Project Overview and Goals

The **ALX Listing App** project aims to scaffold and lay the foundational structure for a modern **Airbnb clone** property listing application.

This initial milestone focuses on setting up a well-organized and scalable codebase using **Next.js 13+**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **ESLint**. By establishing a clean folder structure, reusable components, and adhering to best practices, the project ensures a solid starting point for building a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly listing page.

## 🏗️ Project Structure Explained

The project follows a standard pattern to promote modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

| Directory | Purpose | Example Files |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`components/`** | Houses all reusable UI components. | `components/common/Card.tsx`, `components/common/Button.tsx` |
| **`interfaces/`** | Stores all TypeScript type definitions and interfaces to ensure type safety. | `interfaces/index.ts` (for `CardProps`, `ButtonProps`, etc.) |
| **`constants/`** | Contains static, non-changing data used across the application. | `constants/index.ts` (for API URLs, configuration settings, or UI text) |
| **`public/assets/`** | Organizes static assets that are publicly accessible. | Placeholder images, SVGs, and other media files. |

### **Project Foundation Files**

* `components/common/Card.tsx`: Defines a reusable `Card` component to display information about properties.
* `components/common/Button.tsx`: Defines a reusable `Button` component for interactive actions (e.g., “Book Now”).
* `interfaces/index.ts`: Defines all core TypeScript interfaces (`CardProps`, `ButtonProps`, etc.) for type consistency.

## ⚙️ Technical Requirements

To run this project, you need the following installed locally:

* **Next.js** version **13+**
* **Node.js** version **16+**
* A text editor (e.g., VS Code) with TypeScript and TailwindCSS extensions is highly recommended.

## 💻 Local Run Instructions

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project running on your local machine.

### **1. Install Dependencies**

Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal and install all required packages:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory (if not already there)
cd alx-listing-app

# Install all project dependencies
npm install

### 2. Run the Development Server
** Start the development server, which enables hot reloading for real-time code changes:

# Run the development server
npm run dev

### Access the Application
** Of course! Here is the content prepared as a standard README.md file using Markdown language.
